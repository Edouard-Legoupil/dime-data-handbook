_Development Research in Practice_ is intended to teach all users of development data 
how to handle data effectively, efficiently, and ethically. 
The Handbook leads the reader through a complete empirical research project,
providing links to continuously-updated resources on the DIME Wiki
as well as illustrative examples from 
the Demand for Safe Spaces impact evaluation conducted in Rio de Janeiro. 
The premise is that standardizing and simplifying data tasks 
improves research quality and enables more effective collaboration. 
The first chapter introduces principles for conducting reproducible, 
transparent, and credible development research. 
The second chapter describes technical tools and set-up necessary
for effective research in todayâ€™s collaborative and data-driven world. 
The third chapter details the theory and practice of data-driven measurement frameworks,
including research design, data mapping, and implementation of randomized study designs. 
The fourth chapter covers the data acquisition process for primary and secondary data,
and details special considerations for collecting high-quality survey data. 
The fifth chapter dives into the process of cleaning and exploring research data. 
The sixth chapter provides a guide to building analytical datasets, 
writing data analysis code, and creating reproducible research outputs. 
The seventh chapter addresses research publication, 
including the preparation of reproducibility packages and publishing data. 
The practical approach and narrative structure of these chapters are designed
for both newcomers to empirical research as well as experienced professionals. 
The Development Research in Practice handbook is therefore a quintessential desk reference 
for anyone who handles data as part of a research team, policymakers and managers who oversee such endeavors, 
and students in any discipline who plan to enter the modern research workforce.
