# How to give feedback
First off, thank you for considering giving feedback or  contributing to **Data for Development Impact**.
Any and all feedback to refine this book further or to make this text as comprehensive as possible is appreciated. Following these
guidelines helps communicate any errors we may have overlooked, any concepts that may seem little vague or difficult to comprehend or any topics that we have missed to inlcude.

If you are familiar with how GitHub works, please feel free to submit issues for any section you don't understand or
submit a pull request for any additions you want to make.

## Feedback through Email
While our preference is to receive feedback through GitHub you are always welcome to submit your feedback via our email [dimeanalytics@worldbank.org](mailto:dimeanalytics@worldbank.org)

## Issue submission/review process
If you notice any errors in text or if you need futher clarification for any sentence/concept/section that you think is not 
exhaustively dealt within the book, you can do so by creating an *issue*. You can read issues submitted by other users or 
create a new issue [here](https://github.com/worldbank/d4di/issues). 

For example, if you think the example the authors have used to explain a particular research design is too convoluted to understand, 
creating an issue is useful for you to provide us the feedback that we should use a **simpler example** to explain the research design.
Please read already existing issues to check whether someone else has made the same suggestion or reported the same error 
before creating a new issue.

### Github Issue Submission Format
1. Go to our repository [d4di](https://github.com/worldbank/d4di).
2. Select the issues tab which is situated at the top of the repository folders. In the issues section you can review previously posted 
issues or select the green tab called *New Issue* to post a new comment.
3. Write a very precise title for your issue. Then provide a description containing your suggested corrections 
or additions you want us to see and submit it. We have created labels for every chapter in the book. Please select a label corresponding to
the chapter you are giving the feedback before submitting the issue.
4. In case you are referring to a specific line in the text, go to the .tex file you want to suggest changes to, left-click next to the 
line you wish to attribute the change to and select, *reference in new issue* and follow the same instructions as in point 3.

### Pull Request Process
1. You can fork this repository (i.e. Create a new branch).
2. Create a pull request to add edits to the master branch with a clear description of changes or additions
3. ADMIN will then merge your pull request with the master.
