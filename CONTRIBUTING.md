# How to give feedback
First off, thank you for considering giving feedback or  contributing to **Data for Development Impact**.
Any and all feedback to refine this book further or to make this text as comprehensive as possible is appreciated. Following these
guidelines helps communicate any errors we may have overlooked, any concepts that may seem little vague or difficult to comprehend or any topics that we have missed to inlcude.

If you are familiar with how GitHub works, please feel free to submit issues for any section you don't understand or
submit a pull request with any additions you want to make.

## Feedback through Email
While our preference is to receive feedback through GitHub you are always welcome to submit your feedback via our email [dimeanalytics@worldbank.org](mailto:dimeanalytics@worldbank.org)

## Feedback through GitHub
If you notice any errors in text or if you need further clarification for any sentence/concept/section that you think is not
exhaustively dealt within the book, you can do so by creating an *issue*. You can read issues submitted by other users or 
create a new issue [here](https://github.com/worldbank/d4di/issues). 

For example, if you think the example the authors have used to explain a particular research design is too convoluted to understand, 
creating an issue is useful for you to provide us the feedback that we should use a **simpler example** to explain the research design.
Please read already existing issues to check whether someone else has made the same suggestion or reported the same error 
before creating a new issue.
