# Conclusion {-}

*Development Research in Practice: The DIME Analytics Data Handbook* teaches
readers to handle data more efficiently, effectively, and ethically at all
stages of development research projects. It lays out a start-to-finish vision of
the tasks and workflows that a modern development researcher will need to
undertake, from planning a project’s measurement framework and data strategy to
acquiring and analyzing data to publishing the code and data. Each chapter
explores key tasks and concepts and provides links to resources and DIME Wiki
pages that provide further details and implementation guidance. This structure
is intended to allow readers to return to each chapter as they become
progressively more familiar with individual topics.

## Bringing it all together {-}

Although each chapter is written to stand alone, the recommended workflows
detailed in *Development Research in Practice* build on each other. Adopting the
best practices from early chapters will allow for easier and more intuitive
adoption of workflows and tasks in subsequent chapters. From the design and
structure of measurement frameworks and data acquisition to the creation of
reproducibility packages and data documentation, this book provides the tools
and concepts needed to connect all stages of research coherently rather than
undertaking them as discrete tasks. Figure 8.1 offers a visual representation of
the interconnections among outputs created over the research data life cycle.
It shows how different steps are related, as materials created in one step then
feed into the next and eventually create a complete publication package for a
research product.

The first chapter begins the book with a discussion of credibility,
transparency, and reproducibility in research. The overarching idea is that
research should always be accessible and available to others, both within and
outside the research team. The handbook treats data work as a "social process"
involving multiple team members with different roles and technical abilities.
The fundamental theme of accessible open science research provides structure for
all subsequent tasks and offers both private and public benefits: data work that
is intentionally designed for others to interact with will also be easier for
teams to collaborate on and maintain over time.

This idea is carried through to the second chapter, which introduces the reader
to the technical tools and concepts needed to develop a work environment
conducive to accessible research. An open science approach necessitates
cooperation with a diverse group of collaborators using modern approaches to
computing technology. It requires collective agreement on specific tools and
methods of collaboration and record keeping as well as on technical approaches
like version control, file sharing, and directory organization.

The third chapter translates research design into a specific ­ easurement
framework and data map. The perspective of reproducible research emphasizes the
need to clarify and document how data will describe the research design and
record scientific measurements. The documentation-centric data map approach
ensures that a research team agrees how multiple data sources are intended to be
linked without error and how the structure of those data corresponds to the
research design. It also describes how to use these concepts to implement
research design through reproducible routines for sampling and randomization and
discusses how to analyze and document statistical power.

The fourth chapter turns to modern data acquisition methods and governance
frameworks, including data licensing, data ownership, electronic data
collection, and data security. Establishing clear data ownership and publication
rights at this stage is essential to creating open, reproducible outputs at
publication. For researchers undertaking primary data collection, the chapter
details how to prepare for and implement high-quality electronic surveys and how
to document data structure and data quality. Finally, the chapter describes how
to ensure that all data sets are stored properly and securely to protect the
privacy of research participants and prevent data loss.

The fifth chapter provides a detailed workflow for data cleaning and processing,
emphasizing tidy data, quality control, privacy protection, and documentation.
The workflow calls upon outputs created in previous stages, relying on the data
map and survey documentation to guide the creation of analysis-ready data sets.
The chapter offers specific consideration of how to structure data sets at the
correct units of observation, connecting each unit to the project’s overarching
measurement framework through appropriate identification variables. By the end
of the data-cleaning process, all data points are corrected, variables and
values are labeled, duplicates are resolved, and identifying information is
removed from working copies of the data sets so they can be processed more
rapidly in the analytical stage that follows in the workflow.

The sixth chapter details how to construct data sets that are deliberately
structured for analysis, analyze them effectively and efficiently, and generate
reproducible outputs. The chapter separates data construction, exploratory
analysis, and final analysis—in code as well as in human-readable dynamic
documents—so that final outputs can be incorporated easily into research outputs
for publication. Separating out the final analysis also has the advantage of
producing code that is nearly ready for publication and reproducibility as
written, usually requiring only minor modifications for release.

The seventh chapter provides an overview of the workflow required to move
research results to publication—no matter the format of the output—as well as
the tools and practices for making research publicly accessible. It becomes
clear that following recommended practices at all stages of the research life
cycle greatly simplifies the final publication process. The chapter gives
extensive attention to the collaborative preparation of research outputs,
bringing together technical outputs like figures and tables with versatile
formatting, collaboration, and version-control tools in LaTeX documents. It then
provides guidelines both for releasing and licensing data in a way that balances
the twin responsibilities of privacy and access and for structuring code so that
it is accessible and useful to other readers. The final output is a
reproducibility package that brings together all of the final materials from the
project in a single location, fulfilling the goals laid out in the first
chapter.


## Where to go from here {-}

Throughout *Development Research in Practice,* the narrative provides enough
detail for readers to understand the purpose and function of each of the core
research steps and how they link together. For readability, the number of
technical details and implementation guidelines provided directly in the text is
limited. Instead, this book provides a wide variety of resources for readers to
continue building their knowledge and skills. Sidenotes throughout the book link
to DIME Wiki pages detailing specific protocols, code conventions, and field
procedures that DIME considers best practices. References to theoretical papers
are included to help researchers to figure out how to handle the unique cases
that will undoubtedly arise, and references to examples of various techniques
and situations are also provided throughout.

The book includes case studies from the Demand for Safe Spaces project, which
are used to show how the research tasks described are implemented in practice
and eventually prepared and released to the public. By accessing the various
repositories and resources linked from the Demand for Safe Spaces case study,
readers can examine the original materials and research outputs from a completed
DIME project in detail, including the code and data used to produce them.

This edition of *Development Research in Practice* also has three appendixes
covering important topics that do not fall within the research workflow at any
particular point. Appendix A, the DIME Analytics Coding Guide, includes a
general discussion of considerations for writing good code as part of a research
team and instructions for accessing the code examples throughout the book, and
the style guide that DIME uses for coding in Stata. Appendix B, the DIME
Analytics Resource Directory, provides pointers and descriptions for the
materials, trainings, code tools, and other public goods produced by DIME
Analytics to improve the quality of development research. Appendix C, which
focuses on research design for impact evaluation, provides an overview of modern
methods for work in causal inference and program evaluation, with extensive
links to the DIME Wiki and references to the literature.

This diverse set of resources is intended to allow readers to continue learning
at the level of detail that is appropriate to their role. It provides accessible
and useful approaches for everyone seeking to improve their understanding of the
research process or its practical considerations—from project managers and
principal investigators to research assistants and field staff to students as
well as to research partners and consumers. The introduction to each chapter
includes key responsibilities for different members of a typical research team.
A useful first task for a research team after reading this book would be to
discuss these key responsibilities in the context of the team’s research
projects.

The DIME Analytics team hopes that this book, its appendixes, and the wide range
of resources and examples highlighted throughout will serve as a useful guide
for anyone who participates in or interacts with development research. The book
is also a living document, with a live version available online at
<https://worldbank.github.io/dime-data-handbook> and a GitHub repository for
inputs, discussions, and revisions at
<https://github.com/worldbank/dime-data-handbook>. Both are publicly available,
and readers are invited to participate in the active improvement of this book
and all of the related resources that DIME Analytics maintains, especially the
DIME Wiki (<https://dimewiki.worldbank.org>).
