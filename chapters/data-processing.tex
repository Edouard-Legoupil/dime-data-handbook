% What is data cleaning
The starting point for all tasks described in this chapter is the raw data,
containing the exact files received, with no changes or additions.
Be mindful of how and where these files are stored
as they cannot be re-created and nearly always contain confidential information.
Raw data files must be never be edited directly.
These files may be received in a variety of formats, 
and are often not easy to handle using statistical software.
The data cleaning tasks described in this chapter will prepare the raw data
for quantitative analysis.
The main output of data cleaning, the cleaned dataset,
contains almost exactly same information as the raw data,
with the exception of corrections made to data entry mistakes.
The main difference between the raw and the cleaned data is that the latter
has been put into a format that makes it easier to interact with. 

% Chapter overview
Data cleaning is typically the most time-consuming step in a project's data work \citep{dasu2003exploratory}.
Although original data typically requires more extensive data cleaning than secondary data,
you should carefully examine and clean any data you are about to use.
When reviewing raw data, you will inevitably encounter data entry mistakes,
such as typos and inconsistent values.
This chapter describes the different tasks involved in the cleaning process,
and outlines the workflow that our team adopts to make it efficient and transparent.

\section{Identifying the identifier}

Raw data is received in a variety of shapes and sizes.
Not all of them are easy to read or handle.
The very first step in creating statistical software-friendly data sets
is understanding the data acquired,
and translating this understanding into an intuitive format.
This section discusses what steps may be needed to make sure that each row
in a dataset represents one observation.
This may seem trivial, but should not be taken for granted.
As you will see, getting to such a format may be harder than expected.


\subsection{What makes data tidy}

% Where these concepts come from
Before discussing the details of how to clean your data,
we need to define a few concepts that will be used in this chapter.
They refer to the structure of the data,
and have long been discussed in the database management literature.
However, this section is based on Hadley Wickham's definition of tidy data,\cite{tidy-data}
which uses a terminology that is more intuitive for users of applied statistics,
with our own twist based on the jargon of development research.

% Definitions
Development data is typically acquired in the form of \textbf{tables},
a two-dimensional or rectangular dataset formed by rows and columns.\sidenote{One
example of non-rectangular data is text.}
Each element in this table is a value, or \textbf{data point},
representing a measure of an attribute.
For example, in a survey's household roster,
two of the attributes usually measured are gender and age.
The measures of gender and age for each household member are different data points.
A \textbf{variable} is the collection of all data points that measure a given attribute.
In the example of a household survey,
each variable will correspond to one survey question.
Finally, each variable will contain data points for different subjects in a given unit of observation.
In our example, each household member is a subject, and the unit of observation is a person.
The collection of all data points for each individual subject is an \textbf{observation}.

% Tidy data
The ideal format to interact with any table or dataset is when
each columns represents one variable, each row represents one observation, 
and all variables in a table have the same unit of observation.
Datasets in this format are said to be \textbf{tidy}.
This may seem trivial, but the raw data acquired is frequently untidy.
A very simple way for our survey example to became untidy is to include
household-level variables in the same data set,
such as the material used in the main house.
In this case, some attributes would be measured at
household level, and others at household member level,
and it would not be possible for each column to represent a variable
\textit{and} each row an observation \textit{at the same time}.
Tidy data sets are easier to handle,
as observations can be aggregated and linked consistently,
and easier to clean, as each attribute only needs to be checked once.
The next two sections will outline steps to check if your data is tidy,
and to tidy it if it is not.

\subsection{Unique identifiers}

% Uniquely and fully identifying variable
The first step in tidying you data is to understand the level of observation in the data (what makes a row),
and what variable or set of variables uniquely identifies each row.
Ensuring that observations are uniquely and fully identified\sidenote{\url{
		https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/ID\_Variable\_Properties}}
is possibly the most important step in data cleaning.
It may be the case that the variable expected to be the unique identifier in fact is either incomplete or contains duplicates.
This could be due to duplicate observations or errors in data entry.
It could also be the case that there is no identifying variable, or the identifier is a long string, such as a name.
In this case cleaning begins by carefully creating a variable that uniquely identifies the data.
Checking for duplicated entries is usually part of data quality monitoring,
and is ideally addressed as soon as data is received

% ID variable vs survey key
Note that while modern survey tools create unique identifiers for each submitted data record,
that is not the same as having a unique ID variable for each individual in the sample.
You want to make sure the dataset has a unique ID variable
that can be cross-referenced with other records, such as the master dataset\sidenote{\url{
		https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Master\_Data\_Set}}
and other rounds of data collection.
\texttt{ieduplicates} and \texttt{iecompdup},
two Stata commands included in the \texttt{iefieldkit}
package\index{iefieldkit},\sidenote{\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/iefieldkit}}
create an automated workflow to identify, correct and document
occurrences of duplicate entries.
One advantage of using \texttt{ieduplicates}\sidenote{\url{
	https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/ieduplicates}} 
to correct duplicated entries is that it creates \textit{duplicates reports}
that record which corrections made and why.
Even if you are not using this command,
it is important to include similar records in the \texttt{Documentation} folder.

\subsection{Tidying raw data}

% Is the uniquely identified data tidy?
Sometimes, making sure that the data is uniquely and fully identified 
is enough to yield a tidy dataset.
This happens when a data source or survey instrument
contains a single unit of observation.
If you are working with data in this format,
you lucky enough to be able to skip the tidying process,
which can become quite intricate.
In your case, however, the cleaning process will yield a single cleaned dataset.

% Examples of untidy raw data
The most common case of untidy raw data encountered in development research
are datasets consisting of multiple units of observation stored in the same table. 
If your rows include multiple nested observational units,
having an identifying variable for each row doesn't mean having an identifier for each observation.
This is the case of our previous example of untidy data:
a survey that collects both household and household-member level information.
In this case, 
the easiest way to handle the data is probably to break it into two tidy datasets:
one at household level, and one at household-member level.
You will use these separate datasets for the rest of the data cleaning process,
and combine them to create analysis datasets.

% How to tidy data
Creating these two tidy datasets will involve a few different transformations.
Data collection platforms such as SurveyCTO usually export \textbf{wide datasets},
where each row represents the highest level of observation,
and variables observed in nested units are separated into one column per sub-unit,
such as \texttt{age\_1}, \texttt{gender\_1}, \texttt{age\_2}, \texttt{gender\_2}, etc.
To create tidy datasets from this data,
you first need to identify which variables where observed at which levels.
In our example, the material used in the main house was collected at household level (the higher unit),
while age and gender where observed at the member sub-unit.
You should then separate these variables,
creating a now tidy dataset containing the unique row ID and the household level variables;
and another dataset containing the unique row ID and the household-member level variables.
Finally, you need to \textbf{reshape}\sidenote{\textbf{Reshape:}
	transform a dataset in such a way that the unit of observation represented by a row changes.}
the household-member dataset to a \textbf{longer} format,
where there is a new variable indicating the member ID,
and the \texttt{gender} and \texttt{age} variables are each represented by one column.
You can do this using \texttt{reshape} in Stata, and \texttt{reshape2} or \texttt{pivot\_longer} in R.

% Polishing tidy data
Note that, in this example, 
the household-member level dataset is now uniquely and fully identifiable
by a combination of two variables:
the household level row ID \textit{and} the household-member ID inside each household.
One key aspect in this process is to make sure that these ID variables are consistent across tables.
This means that if you want to calculate the share of women members in a household,
and link it back to the household level table, 
you should be able to do so through the household level row ID.
Another possible consequence of reshaping to keep in mind is that
empty observations may be created in the long dataset
(this is particularly the case in Stata).
Remember do remove such observations,
or they may bias aggregated measures -- counts in particular.

% Generalizing
If each row in the untidy data set represents the lower level of observation,
the same data point for the higher level of observation will be repeated for all its sub-units.
After you have separated into two tables containing the variables observed at each level,
the table that contains the smaller level will already be in a tidy format.
So all you need to do is make sure that all rows for the larger unit have the same value for each variable.
The tidying process can get more complex if the instrument includes multiple nested groups.
In agricultural surveys, it is not uncommon to find household-plot-season-crop level observations,
as well as different combinations of these level,
such as household-plot and household-crop-season, in the same dataset.
That means the steps of identifying the unit of observation of each variable
and reshaping the separated tables needs to be repeated multiple times.
In these case, it is particularly important to be mindful of cross-table identifiers,
as they are often not the same as wide variables suffixes.

% Wrap-up
Tidying datasets can be a complex process.
However, the more nested groups a dataset includes,
the more efficient it is to deal with tidy data as compared to untidy.
Cleaning and constructing wide datasets, in particular,
is a repetitive and error-prone process.
The next step of data cleaning, data quality monitoring,
may involve comparing different units of observation.
Aggregating sub-units to compare to a higher unit is much easier with tidy data.
This is why we suggest getting your data into a tidy format as early as possible in your workflow. 
 
%------------------------------------------------
\section{Data quality assurance}

Whether you are acquiring data from a partner or collecting it directly,
it is important to make sure that data faithfully reflects ground realities.
Data quality assurance requires a combination of real-time data checks
and back-checks or validation audits, which often means tracking down
the people whose information is in the dataset.

\subsection{Implementing high frequency quality checks}

% What are HFCs
A key advantage of continuous electronic data intake methods,
as compared to traditional paper surveys and one-time data dumps,
is the ability to access and analyze the data while the project is ongoing.
Data issues can be identified and resolved in real-time.
Designing systematic data checks and running them routinely throughout data intake
simplifies monitoring and improves data quality.
As part of data acquisition preparation,
the research team should develop a \textbf{data quality assurance plan}\sidenote{
	\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Data\_Quality\_Assurance\_Plan}}.
While data acquisition is ongoing,
a research assistant or data analyst should work closely with the field team or partner
to ensure that the data collection is progressing correctly,
and set up and perform \textbf{high-frequency checks (HFCs)} with the incoming data.

% Why they should be made in real-time
High-frequency checks (HFCs) should carefully inspect key treatment and outcome variables
so that the data quality of core experimental variables is uniformly high,
and that additional effort is centered where it is most important.
Data quality checks should be run on the data every time it is received from the field or partner
to flag irregularities in the aquisition progress, in sample completeness, or in response quality.
The faster issues are identified, the more likely they are to be solved.
\texttt{ipacheck}\sidenote{
	\url{https://github.com/PovertyAction/high-frequency-checks/wiki}}
is a very useful command that automates some of these tasks,
regardless of the source of the data.

% Completeness
It is important to check continuously that the observations in the data match the intended sample.
In surveys, the software often provides some form of case management features
through which sampled units are directly assigned to individual enumerators.
For data received from partners, this may be harder to validate,
since they are the authoritative source of the data,
so cross-referencing with other data sources may be necessary to ensure completeness of the data.
Even with careful management, it is often the case that raw data includes duplicate or missing entries,
which may occur due to data entry errors or failed submissions to data servers.\sidenote{
	\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Duplicates_and_Survey_Logs}}
\texttt{ieduplicates}\sidenote{
	\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/ieduplicates}}
provides a workflow for collaborating on the resolution of duplicate entries between you and the provider.
Then, observed units in the data must be validated against the expected sample:
this is as straightforward as merging the sample list with the survey data and checking for mismatches.
Reporting errors and duplicate observations in real-time allows the field team to make corrections efficiently.
Tracking data collection progress is important for monitoring attrition,
so that it is clear early on if a change in protocols or additional tracking will be needed.
It is also important to check data collection completion rate
and sample compliance by surveyor and survey team, if applicable,
or compare data missingness across administrative regions,
to identify any clusters that may be providing data of suspect quality.

% Consistency
High frequency checks should also include content-specific data checks.
Electronic survey and data entry software often incorporates many quality control features,
so these checks should focus on issues survey software cannot check automatically.
As most of these checks are project specific,
it is difficult to provide general guidance.
An in-depth knowledge of the questionnaire and a careful examination of the analysis plan
is the best preparation.
Examples include verifying consistency across multiple response fields or data sources,
validation of complex calculations like crop yields or medicine stocks (which require unit conversions),
suspicious patterns in survey timing,
or atypical response patters from specific data sources or enumerators.\sidenote{
	\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Monitoring_Data_Quality}}
Electronic data entry software typically provides rich metadata,
which can be useful in assessing data quality.
For example, automatically collected timestamps show when data was submitted
and (for surveys) how long enumerators spent on each question,
and trace histories show how many
times answers were changed before or after the data was submitted.

% Following up on flagged issues
High-frequency checks will only improve data quality
if the issues they catch are communicated to the data provider.
There are lots of ways to do this;
what's most important is to find a way to create actionable information for your team.
\texttt{ipacheck}, for example, generates a spreadsheet with flagged errors;
these can be sent directly to the data collection teams.
Many teams choose other formats to display results,
such as online dashboards created by custom scripts.
It is also possible to automate communication of errors to the field team
by adding scripts to link the HFCs with a messaging program such as WhatsApp.
Any of these solutions are possible:
what works best for your team will depend on such variables as
cellular networks in field work areas, whether field supervisors have access to laptops,
internet speed, and coding skills of the team preparing the HFC workflows.

\subsection{Conducting back-checks and data validation}

% Conducting back-checks
Careful validation of data is essential for high-quality data.
Since we cannot control natural measurement error
that comes from variation in the realization of key outcomes,
original data collection provides the opportunity to make sure
that there is no error arising from inaccuracies in the data itself.
\textbf{Back-checks}\sidenote{\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Back\_Checks}} and
other validation audits help ensure that data collection is following established protocols,
and that data is not fasified, incomplete, or otherwise suspect.
For back-checks and validation audits, a random subset of the main data is selected,
and a subset of information from the full survey is
verified through a brief targeted survey with the original respondent
or a cross-referenced dataset from another source (if the original data is not a field survey).
Design of the back-checks or validations follows the same survey design
principles discussed above: you should use the analysis plan
or list of key outcomes to establish which subset of variables to prioritize,
and similarly focus on errors that would be major flags for poor quality data.

% How to implement back-checks
Real-time access to the data massively increases the potential utility of validation,
and both simplifies and improves the rigor of the associated workflows.
You can use the raw data to draw the back-check or validation sample;
this ensures that the validation is correctly apportioned across observations.
As soon as checking is complete, the validation data can be tested against
the original data to identify areas of concern in real-time.
The \texttt{bcstats} command is a useful tool for analyzing back-check data in Stata.\sidenote{
	\url{https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s458173.html}}
Some electronic surveys surveys also provide a unique opportunity
to do audits through audio recordings of the interview,
typically short recordings triggered at random throughout the questionnaire.
\textbf{Audio audits} are a useful means to assess whether enumerators are conducting interviews as expected.
Do note, however, that audio audits must be included in the informed consent for the respondents.


\section{De-identifying research data}

Up to this point, you were probably handling confidential data.
This is due to the fact that effective data quality monitoring
frequently requires you to identify the individual observations in your dataset,
and the people who acquired information about them.
Having this data will allow you to quickly follow-up on issues identified,
and verify what caused them.
Handling confidential data such as \textbf{personally-identifying information}\index{
	personally-identifying information}
requires a secure environment and often involves
decrypting data before accessing it, and encrypting it back afterward.
De-identifiying the data simplifies this workflow and reduces the risk of harmful leaks.
This section describes how to perform de-identification of data 
to be shared within a research team and with a wider audience.

\subsection{Protecting privacy as researcher}

% Dealing with human subjects
Most of the field research done in development involves human subjects.\sidenote{
	\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Human_Subjects_Approval}}
\index{human subjects}
As a researcher, you may have access to personal information about your subjects:
where they live, how rich they are, whether they have committed or been victims of crimes,
their names, their national identity numbers, among other sensitive data.
PII data carries strict expectations about data storage and handling,
and it is the responsibility of the research team to satisfy these expectations.\sidenote{
	\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Research\_Ethics}}
Your donor or employer will most likely require you to hold a certification from a source
such as Protecting Human Research Participants\sidenote{
	\url{https://phrptraining.com}}
or the CITI Program;\sidenote{
	\url{https://about.citiprogram.org/en/series/human-subjects-research-hsr}}
and your team will need to present a plan to handle this data securely for IRB approval.

% Options for dealing with PII data: only collect it if extremely necessary, encrypt it, restrict access, de-identify it
In general, though, you shouldn't need to handle PII data very often
once the data collection processes are completed.
You can take simple steps to avoid risks by minimizing the handling of PII.
First, only collect information that is strictly needed for the research.
Second, avoid the proliferation of copies of identified data.
There should never be more than one copy of the raw identified dataset in the project folder,
and it must always be encrypted.
Even within the research team,
access to PII data should be limited to team members who require it for their specific tasks.
Data analysis that requires identifying information is rare
and in most cases can be avoided by properly linking identifiers to research information
such as treatment statuses and weights, then removing identifiers.

% De-identification vs anonymization
Therefore, once data is securely collected and stored,
the first thing you will generally do is \textbf{de-identify} it,
that is, remove direct identifiers of the individuals in the dataset.\sidenote{
	\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/De-identification}}
\index{de-identification}
Note, however, that it is in practice impossible to \textbf{anonymize} data.
There is always some statistical chance that an individual's identity
will be re-linked to the data collected about them
-- even if that data has had all directly identifying information removed --
by using some other data that becomes identifying when analyzed together.
For this reason, we recommend de-identification in two stages.
The \textbf{initial de-identification} process strips the data of direct identifiers
as early in the process as possible,
to create a working de-identified dataset that
can be shared \textit{within the research team} without the need for encryption.
This simplifies workflows.
The \textbf{final de-identification} process involves
making a decision about the trade-off between
risk of disclosure and utility of the data
before publicly releasing a dataset.\sidenote{
	\url{https://sdcpractice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SDC\_intro.html\#need-for-sdc}}
The following section describes how to implement these processes.


\subsection{De-identification in practice}

% Initial de-identification
To simplify workflows, the raw data should be de-identified as early as possible.
Once you create a de-identified version of the dataset,
you no longer need to interact directly with the encrypted raw data.
During the initial round of de-identification, 
dataset must be stripped of personally identifying information.\sidenote{
	\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/De-identification}}
To do so, you will need to identify all variables that contain
such information.\sidenote{\url{
		https://www.povertyactionlab.org/sites/default/files/resources/J-PAL-guide-to-deidentifying-data.pdf}}
For data collection, where the research team designs the survey instrument,
flagging all potentially identifying variables in the questionnaire design stage
simplifies the initial de-identification process.
If you did not do that, or you received original data by another means,
there are a few tools to help flag variables with personally-identifying data.
JPAL's \texttt{PII scan}, as indicated by its name,
scans variable names and labels for common string patterns associated with identifying information.\sidenote{
	\url{https://github.com/J-PAL/PII-Scan}}
The World Bank's \texttt{sdcMicro}
lists variables that uniquely identify observations, 
but it is less efficient for large datasets.\sidenote{
	\url{https://sdctools.github.io/sdcMicro/articles/sdcMicro.html}}
The \texttt{iefieldkit} command \texttt{iecodebook}
lists all variables in a dataset and exports an Excel sheet
where you can easily select which variables to keep or drop.\sidenote{
	\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Iecodebook}}

% Initial de-identification in practice
Once you have a list of variables that contain confidential information,
assess them against the analysis plan and first ask yourself for each variable:
\textit{will this variable be needed for the analysis?}
If not, the variable should be dropped.
Don't be afraid to drop too many variables the first time,
as you can always go back and remove variables from the list of variables to be dropped,
but you can not go back in time and drop a PII variable that was leaked
because it was incorrectly kept.
Examples include respondent names and phone numbers, enumerator names, taxpayer 
numbers, and addresses.
For each confidential variable that is needed in the analysis, ask yourself:
\textit{can I encode or otherwise construct a variable that masks the confidential component, and
	then drop this variable?}
This is typically the case for most identifying information.
Examples include geocoordinates
(after constructing measures of distance or area,
drop the specific location)
and names for social network analysis (can be encoded to secret and unique IDs).
If the answer to either of the two questions above is yes,
all you need to do is write a script to drop the variables that are not required for analysis,
encode or otherwise mask those that are required,
and save a working version of the data.
If confidential information strictly required for the analysis itself and can not be
masked or encoded,
it will be necessary to keep at least a subset of the data encrypted through
the data analysis process.

% Final de-identification: sdcMicro
The dataset created by the initial de-identification will be the underlying source for all cleaned and constructed data.
This is the dataset that you will interact with directly during the remaining tasks described in this chapter.
Because identifying information is typically only used during data collection,
when teams need to find and confirm the identity of interviewees,
de-identification should not affect the usability of the data.
However, access to this data should still be restricted to the research team only,
as it's possible that combining a group of variables,
or taking into account information that is not the dataset,
may lead to the identification of the individuals in the sample.
It is common, and even desirable, for teams to make data publicly available
once the tasks discussed in this chapter are concluded.
This will allow other researchers to conduct additional analysis and to reproduce your finding.
Before that can be done, however,
a careful analysis of the risk of disclosure and a final round of de-identification must be conducted.
The World Bank's \texttt{sdcMicro} allos for sophisticated disclosure risk calculations.\sidenote{
	\url{https://sdctools.github.io/sdcMicro/articles/sdcMicro.html}}
There is no clear cut about what is an acceptable level of disclosure,
so your team must weight the trade-off between transparency and privacy,
and make a decision that is specific to the data.
In general, it's preferable to be conservative and include additional layers of security
to access variable that represent a higher disclosure risk.


\section{Preparing data for analysis}

% What is data cleaning
The last step in the data cleaning process involves
(1) making the dataset easy to use and understand, and 
(2) carefully exploring each variable to document their distributions 
and identify patterns that may bias the analysis.
The resulting dataset will contain only the variables collected in the field, and
no modifications to data points will be made, 
except for corrections of mistaken entries.
Apart from the \textbf{cleaned dataset} (or datasets) itself,
cleaning will also yield extensive documentation describing  it.

% Section overview
During data cleaning, you will acquire in-depth understanding of the contents and structure of your data.
This knowledge will be key to correctly construct final indicators and analyze them.
So don't rush through this step.
It is common for cleaning to be the most time-consuming task in a project.
In this section, we will introduce some concepts and tools to make it more efficient and productive.
The section is separated into three topics:
exploring the data, making corrections, and recoding and annotating.
They are separated here because they are different in nature.
In practice, however, they are all done at the same time.


\subsection{Getting to know your data}

% What to look for when exploring the data
The first time you interact with your data is during quality checks.
However, these checks are often programmed before you receive all the data.
Furthermore, because quality checks are usually time-sensitive, 
there may not be time to explore the data at length.
During data cleaning, on the other hand, 
you will need to inspect each variable closely.
Use tabulations, summary statistics, histograms and density plots to understand the structure of data,
and look for irregularities.
Think critically about what you see:
are the values shown consistent with the information the variable represents?
How do distributions look? 
Are there any outliers, or missing values?
Could distributional patterns be caused by data entry errors?
Are variables consistent with each other?

% Document patterns rather than fix them
At this point, it is more important to document your findings
than to try to address any irregularities found.
There is a very limited set of changes that should be made to the raw data during cleaning.
They are described in the next two sections,
and are usually applied to each variable as you explore them.
Most transformation resulting in data points that were not directly observed in the original data
will be done during \textbf{construction}, a process discussed in the next chapter.
For now, focus on creating a record of what you observe,
and save it in the \texttt{Documentation} folder that corresponds to the data being explored.
You will use this documentation when discussing with your team
how to address irregularities when you get to the construction stage.
This material will also be valuable during exploratory data analysis.

%\subsection{Correcting data points}

\subsection{Recoding and annotating data}

% Why recoding and annotating data are important
The cleaned dataset is the starting point of data analysis.
It will be extensively manipulated to construct analysis indicators,
so it is important for it to be easily processed by statistical software.
To make the analysis process smoother, 
anyone opening it for the first time should have all the information needed to interact with it,
even if they were not involved in the acquisition or cleaning process.
This will save them time going back as forward between the dataset and its accompanying documentation. 

% Encoding variables
Often times, datasets are not imported into statistical software in the most efficient format.
The most common example are string variables:
categorical variables and open-ended responses are often read as strings.
However, variables in these format cannot be used for quantitative analysis.
Therefore, categorical variables must be transformed into easier to use formats,
such as \texttt{factors} in R and \texttt{labeled integers}\sidenote{\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Data\_Cleaning\#Value\_Labels}} in Stata.
Additionally, open-ended responses stored as strings usually have a high risk of being identifiers, 
so cleaning them requires extra attention.
The option names in categorical variables
(called \textit{value labels} in Stata and \textit{levels} in R)
should be accurate and concise, 
and correspond exactly to the data collection instrument.
Adding option names to categorical variables 
makes it easier to understand your data as you explore it,
and thus reduces the risk of small errors making their way through into the analysis stage.

% Recoding missing values
In survey data, it is common for non-responses such as ``Don't know'' and ``Declined to answer''
to be represented by negative survey codes. 
The presence of these negative values could bias your analysis,
since they don't represent actual observations of a variable.
So they need to be turned into \textit{missing values}.
However, the fact that a respondent didn't know how to answer a question is also useful information,
that would be lost by this transformation.
In Stata, this information can be elegantly conserved using extended missing values.\sidenote{
	\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Data\_Cleaning\#Survey\_Codes\_and\_Missing\_Values}}

% Labeling variables
We recommend that the cleaned data set by kept as similar to the raw data as possible.
This is particularly important regarding variable names:
keeping them consistent with the raw data makes data processing and construction more transparent.
Unfortunately, not all variable names are informative.
In such cases, one important piece of documentation,
the variable dictionary, makes the data easier to handle.
When a data collection instrument is available, 
it is often the best dictionary one could ask for.
But even in this cases, going back-and-forth between files can be inefficient,
so annotating variables in a dataset is extremely useful.
In Stata, \textit{variable labels}\sidenote{\url{
	https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Data\_Cleaning\#Variable\_Labels}} must always be present in a cleaned dataset.
They should include a short and clear description of the variable.
A lengthier description, that may include, for example,
the exact wording of a question, may be added through \textit{variable notes}.
In R, it is less common to use variable labels,
and a separate dataset with a variable dictionary is often preferred,
but \texttt{dataframe attributes} can be used for the same purpose.

% Dropping irrelevant variables
Finally, any information that is not relevant for analysis may be removed from the dataset.
In primary data, it is common to collect information for quality monitoring purposes,
such as notes, duration fields and surveyor IDs.
Once you are past the quality monitoring phase,
these variables may be removed from your dataset.
In fact, to make the data easier to handle,
you may choose to start from a minimal set of variables,
and add new ones as you clean them.
To make sure the cleaned dataset file doesn't get too big to be handled,
use commands such as \texttt{compress} in Stata to make sure the data
is always stored in the most efficient format.

% Cleaning tools: iecodebook, tidyverse
Although all these tasks are key to making the data easy to use,
implementing them can be quite repetitive and create convoluted scripts.
The \texttt{iecodebook} command suite, part of the \texttt{iefieldkit} Stata package,
is designed to make some of the most tedious components of this process more efficient.\sidenote{

It also creates a self-documenting workflow,
so your data cleaning documentation is created alongside that code,
with no extra steps.
As far as we know, there are no similar resources in R.
However, the \texttt{tidyverse}\sidenote{\url{https://www.tidyverse.org/}} packages
compose a consistent and useful grammar to perform the same tasks.
