This is a draft peer review edition of
\textit{Data for Development Impact:
The DIME Analytics Resource Guide}.
This version of the book has been substantially revised
since the first release in June 2019
with feedback from readers and other experts.
It now contains most of the major content
that we hope to include in the finished version,
and we are in the process of making final additions
and polishing the materials to formally publish it.

This book is intended to remain a living product
that is written and maintained in the open.
The raw code and edit history are online at:
