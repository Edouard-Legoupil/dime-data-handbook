This is the first edition of
\textit{Data for Development Impact:
The DIME Analytics Resource Guide}.
The DIME Analytics team is releasing this edition
to coincide with the annual \textit{Manage Successful Impact Evaluations} training,
so that a wide group of people who make up
part of the core audience for this book,
can use the book to supplement that training
and provide feedback and improvements on it.

Whether you are a training participant,
a DIME team member, or you work for the World Bank
or another organization or university,
we ask that you read the contents of this book carefully and critically.
It is available as a PDF for your convenience at:
\url{https://worldbank.github.com/d4di}.
This website also includes the most updated instructions
for providing feedback, as well as
a log of errata and updates that have been made to the content.

We encourage feedback and corrections
so that we can improve the contents of the book
in future editions.
Please feel free to provide any type of feedback,
no matter how small,
as these work together to improve the content overall.
If you are familiar with GitHub,
you can create ``issues'' with suggestions for improvement
at \url{https://www.github.com/worldbank/d4di/issues},
or contribute directly by forking the repository.
You can also email us at \texttt{dimeanlytics@worldbank.org}
with input or comments, and we will be very thankful.
We hope you enjoy the book!
