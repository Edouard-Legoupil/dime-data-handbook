\begin{fullwidth}
Sampling, randomization, and power calculations are the core elements of experimental design.
\textbf{Sampling} and \textbf{randomization} determine
which units are observed and in which states.
Each of these processes introduces statistical noise
or uncertainty into the final estimates of effect sizes.
Sampling noise produces some probability of
selection of units to measure that will produce significantly wrong estimates, and
randomization noise produces some probability of
placement of units into treatment arms that does the same.
Power calculation is the method by which these probabilities of error are meaningfully assessed.
Good experimental design has high \textbf{power} -- a low likelihood that these noise parameters
will meaningfully affect estimates of treatment effects.

Not all studies are capable of achieving traditionally high power:
the possible sampling or treatment assignments may simply be fundamentally too noisy.
This may be especially true for novel or small-scale studies --
things that have never been tried before may be hard to fund or execute at scale.
What is important is that every study includes reasonable estimates of its power,
so that the evidentiary value of its results can be honestly assessed.
Demonstrating that sampling and randomization were taken seriously into consideration
before going to field lends credibility to any research study.
Using these tools to design the most highly-powered experiments possible
is a responsible and ethical use of donor and client resources,
and maximizes the likelihood that reported effect sizes are accurate.

\section{Random processes in Stata}

Most experimental designs rely directly on random processes,
particularly sampling and randomization, to be executed in code.
The fundamental econometrics behind impact evaluation
depends on establishing that the observations in the sample
and any experimental treatment assignment processes are truly random.
Therefore, understanding and programming for sampling and randomization
is essential to ensuring that planned experiments
are correctly implemented in the field, so that the results
can be interpreted according to the experimental design.
(Note that there are two distinct concepts referred to here by ``randomization'':
the conceptual process of assigning units to treatment arms,
and the technical process of assigning random numbers in statistical software,
which is a part of all tasks that include a random component.\sidenote{
  \url{https://blog.stata.com/2016/03/10/how-to-generate-random-numbers-in-stata/}})

Randomization is challenging. It is deeply unintuitive for the human brain.
``True'' randomization is also nearly impossible to achieve for computers,
which are inherently deterministic. There are plenty of sources to read about this.\sidenote{
  \url{https://www.random.org/randomness/}}
For our purposes, we will focus on what you need to understand
in order to produce truly random results for your project using Stata,
and how you can make sure you can get those exact results again in the future.
This takes a combination of strict rules, solid understanding, and careful programming.
This section introduces the strict rules: these are non-negotiable (but thankfully simple).
The second section provides basic introductions to the tasks of sampling and randomization,
and the third introduces common varieties encountered in the field.
The fourth section discusses more advanced topics that are used
to analyze the random processes directly in order to understand their properties.
However, the needs you will encounter in the field will inevitably
be more complex than anything we present here,
and you will need to recombine these lessons to match your project's needs.

\subsection{Reproducibility in random Stata processes}

Reproducibility in statistical programming means that random results
can be re-obtained at a future time.
All random methods should be reproducible.\cite{orozco2018make}
Stata, like most statistical software, uses a \textbf{pseudo-random number generator}.
Basically, it has a really long ordered list of numbers with the property that
knowing the previous one gives you precisely zero information about the next one.
Stata uses one of these numbers every time it has a task that is non-deterministic.
In ordinary use, it will cycle through these numbers starting from a fixed point
every time you restart Stata, and by the time you get to any given script,
the current state and the subsequent states will be as good as random.\sidenote{
  \url{https://www.stata.com/manuals14/rsetseed.pdf}}
However, for true reproducible randomization, we need two additional properties:
we need to be able to fix the starting point so we can come back to it later;
and we need that starting point to be independently random from our process.
In Stata, this is accomplished through three command concepts:
\textbf{versioning}, \textbf{sorting}, and \textbf{seeding}.

\textbf{Versioning} means using the same version of the software.
If anything is different, the underlying randomization algorithms may have changed,
and it will be impossible to recover the original result.
In Stata, the \texttt{version} command ensures that the software algorithm is fixed.
We recommend using \texttt{version 13.1} for back-compatibility;
the algorithm was changed after Stata 14 but its improvements do not matter in practice.
(Note that you will \textit{never} be able to transfer a randomization to another software such as R.)
The \texttt{ieboilstart} command in \texttt{ietoolkit} provides functionality to support this requirement.\sidenote{
  \url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/ieboilstart}}
We recommend, you use \texttt{ieboilstart} at the beginning of your master do-file.\sidenote{
  \url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Master_Do-files}}
However, note that testing your do-files without running them
via the master do-file may produce different resuls:
Stata's \texttt{version} expires after execution just like a \texttt{local}.

\textbf{Sorting} means that the actual data that the random process is run on is fixed;
because numbers are assigned to each observation in sequence,
changing their order will change the result of the process.
A corollary is that the underlying data must be unchanged between runs:
you must make a fixed final copy of the data when you run a randomization for fieldwork.
In Stata, the only way to guarantee a unique sorting order is to use\texttt{isid [id\_variable], sort}. (The \texttt{sort , stable} command is insufficient.)
You can additional use the \texttt{datasignature} commannd to make sure the data is fixed.

\textbf{Seeding} means manually setting the start-point of the randomization algorithm.
You can draw a six-digit seed randomly by visiting \url{http://bit.ly/stata-random}.
There are many more seeds possible but this is a large enough set for most purposes.
In Stata, \texttt{set seed [seed]} will set the generator to that state.
You should use exactly one seed per randomization process:
what is important is that each of these seeds is truly random.
You will see in the code below that we include the source and timestamp for verification.
Any process that includes a random component is a random process,
including sampling, randomization, power calculation, and algorithms like bootstrapping.
Other commands may induce randomness or alter the seed without you realizing it,
so carefully confirm exactly how your code runs before finalizing it.\sidenote{
  \url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Randomization_in_Stata}}
To confirm that a randomization has worked well before finalizing its results,
save the outputs of the process in a temporary location,
re-run the code, and use \texttt{cf} or \texttt{datasignature} to ensure nothing has changed.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Simple sampling and randomization}

\subsection{Sampling}

\textbf{Sampling} is the process of randomly selecting units of observation
\index{sampling}
from a master list for survey data collection.\sidenote{\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Sampling_\%26_Power_Calculations}}
This list may be called a \textbf{sampling universe}, a \textbf{listing frame}, or something similar.
We refer to it as a \textbf{master data set}\sidenote{\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Master_Data_Set}}
because it is the authoritative source
for the existence and fixed characteristics of each of the units that may be surveyed.\sidenote{\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Unit_of_Observation}}
If data collected in the field contradicts the master data,
the master data always dominates
(unless the field data is so inconsistent that a master update is necessary).
Most importantly, the master data set indicates
how many individuals are eligible for sampling and surveying,
and therefore contains statistical information
about the likelihood that each will be chosen.

The code below demonstrates how to take
a uniform-probability random sample
from a population using the \texttt{sample} command.
More advanced sampling techniques,
such as clustering and stratification,
are in practice identical in implementation
to the randomization section that follows --
instead of creating a \texttt{treatment} variable,
create a \texttt{sample} variable.

\section{Randomization}

\textbf{Randomization} is the process of assigning units to some kind of treatment program.
Many of the Stata techniques shown here can also be used for sampling,
by understanding ``being included in the sample'' as a treatment in itself.
Randomization is used to assign treatment programs in development research
because it guarantees that, \textit{on average},
the treatment will not be correlated with anything it did not cause.\cite{duflo2007using}
However, as you have just seen,
any random process induces noise: so does randomization.
You may get unlucky and create important correlations by chance --
in fact, you can almost always identify some treatment assignment that
creates the appearance of statistical relationships that are not really there.
This section will show you how to assess and control this \textbf{randomization noise}.

To do that, we create a randomization \textbf{program}, which
\index{programming}
allows us to re-run the randomization method many times
and assess the amount of randomization noise correctly.\sidenote{\url{https://data.princeton.edu/stata/programming}}
Storing the randomization code as a program allows us to access the whole code block
with a single line of code, so we can tinker with the randomization process
separately from its application to the data.
Programming takes a few lines of code that may be new to you,
but getting used to this structure is very useful.
A simple randomization program is shown below.
This code randomizes observations into two groups by combining
\texttt{xtile} and \texttt{recode},
which can be extended to any proportions for any number of arms.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Clustering and stratification}

To control randomization noise, we often use techniques
\index{clustering}\index{stratification}
that reduce the likelihood of a ``bad draw''.\cite{athey2017econometrics}
These techniques can be used in any random process,
including sampling; their implementation is nearly identical in code.

\subsection{Clustering}

Many studies collect data at a different level of observation than the randomization unit.\sidenote{\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Unit_of_Observation}}
For example, a policy may only be able to affect an entire village,
but you are interested in household behavior.
This type of structure is called \textbf{clustering},\sidenote{\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Multi-stage_(Cluster)_Sampling}}
because the units are assigned to treatment in clusters.
Because the treatments are assigned in clusters, however,
there are in reality fewer randomized groups than the number of units in the data.
Therefore, standard errors for clustered designs must also be clustered,
at the level at which the treatment was assigned.\sidenote{\url{https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/when-should-you-cluster-standard-errors-new-wisdom-econometrics-oracle}}

Clustered randomization must typically be implemented manually;
it typically relies on subsetting the data intelligently
to the desired assignment levels.
We demonstrate here.

\subsection{Stratification}


We mean this in a specific way: we want to exclude
randomizations with certain correlations,
or we want to improve the \textbf{balance}
of the average randomization draw.\cite{bruhn2009pursuit}
The most common is \textbf{stratification},\sidenote{\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Stratified_Random_Sample}}
which splits the sampling frame into ``similar'' groups -- \textbf{strata} --
and randomizes \textit{within} each of these groups.
It is important to preserve the overall likelihood for each unit to be included,
otherwise statistical corrections become necessary.
For a simple stratified randomization design,
it is necessary to include strata \textbf{fixed effects},
or an indicator variable for each strata, in any final regression.
This accounts for the fact that randomizations were conducted within the strata,
by comparing each unit to the others within its own strata.

However, manually implementing stratified randomization
is prone to error: in particular, it is difficult to precisely account
for the interaction of group sizes and multiple treatment arms,
particularly when a given strata can contain a small number of clusters,
and when there are a large number of treatment arms.\cite{carril2017dealing}
The user-written \texttt{randtreat} command
properly implements stratification,
with navigable options for handling common pitfalls.
We demonstrate the use of this command here.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Power calculation and randomization inference}

The fundamental contribution of sampling to the power of a research design is this:
if you randomly sample a set number of observations from a set frame,
there are a large -- but fixed -- number of sample sets which you may draw.\sidenote{\url{https://davegiles.blogspot.com/2019/04/what-is-permutation-test.html}}
From any large group, you can find some possible sample sets
that have higher-than-average values of some measure;
similarly, you can find some sets that have lower-than-average values.
The variation of these values across the range of all possible sample sets is what creates
\textbf{sampling noise}, the uncertainty in statistical estimates caused by sampling.
\index{sampling noise}

\subsection{Sampling error and randomization noise}

Portions of this noise can be reduced through design choices
such as clustering and stratification.
In general, all sampling requires \textbf{inverse probability weights}.
These are conceptually simple in that the weights for each individual must be precisely the inverse of the probability
with which that individual is included in the sample, but may be practically difficult to calculate for complex methods.
When the sampling probability is uniform, all the weights are equal to one.
Sampling can be structured such that subgroups are guaranteed to appear in a sample:
that is, you can pick ``half the level one facilities and half the level two facilities'' instead of
``half of all facilities''. The key here is that, \textit{for each facility},
the probability of being chosen remains the same -- 0.5.
By contrast, a sampling design that chooses unbalanced proportions of subgroups
has changed the probability that a given individual is included in the sample,
and needs to be reweighted in case you want to calculate overall average statistics.\sidenote{\url{http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/tools-of-the-trade-when-to-use-those-sample-weights}}

The sampling noise in the process that we choose
determines the size of the confidence intervals
for any estimates generated from that sample.\sidenote{\url{https://economistjourney.blogspot.com/2018/06/what-is-sampling-noise.html}}
In general, for any underlying distribution,
the Central Limit Theorem implies that
the distribution of variation across the possible samples is exactly normal.
Therefore, we can use what are called \textbf{asymptotic standard errors}
to express how far away from the true population parameters our estimates are likely to be.
These standard errors can be calculated with only two datapoints:
the sample size and the standard deviation of the value in the chosen sample.
The code below illustrates the fact that sampling noise
has a distribution in the sense that some actual executions of the sample
give estimation results far from the true value,
and others give results close to it.

The output of the code is a distribution of means in sub-populations of the overall data.
This distribution is centered around the true population mean,
but its dispersion depends on the exact structure of the population.
We use an estimate of the population variation taken from the sample
to assess how far away from that true mean any given sample draw is:
essentially, we estimate the properties of the distribution you see now.
With that estimate, we can quantify the uncertainty in estimates due to sampling noise,
calculate precisely how far away from the true mean
our sample-based estimate is likely to be,
and report that as the standard error of our point estimates.
The interpretation of, say, a 95\% \textbf{confidence interval}
\index{confidence interval}
in this context is that, conditional on our sampling strategy,
we would anticipate that 95\% of future samples from the same distribution
would lead to parameter estimates in the indicated range.
This approach says nothing about the truth or falsehood of any hypothesis.

With this program created and executed,
the next part of the code, shown below,
can set up for reproducibility.
Then it will call the randomization program by name,
which executes the exact randomization process we programmed
to the data currently loaded in memory.
Having pre-programmed the exact randomization does two things:
it lets us write this next code chunk much more simply,
and it allows us to reuse that precise randomization as needed.
Specifically, the user-written \texttt{ritest} command\sidenote{\url{http://hesss.org/ritest.pdf}}
\index{randomization inference}
allows us to execute a given randomization program repeatedly,
visualize how the randomization might have gone differently,
and calculate alternative p-values against null hypotheses.
These \textbf{randomization inference}\sidenote{\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Randomization\_Inference}} significance levels may be very different
than those given by asymptotic confidence intervals,
particularly in small samples (up to several hundred clusters).

After generating the ``true'' treatment assignment,
\texttt{ritest} illustrates the distribution of correlations
that randomization can spuriously produce
between \texttt{price} and \texttt{treatment}.

\subsection{Power calculations}

When we have decided on a practical sampling and randomization design,
we next assess its \textbf{power}.\sidenote{\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Power_Calculations_in_Stata}}
\index{power}
Statistical power can be described in a few ways,
each of which has different uses.\sidenote{\url{http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/chap20.pdf}}
The purpose of power calculations is not to
demonstrate that a study is ``strong'',
but rather to identify where the strengths and weaknesses
of your design are located, so that readers
can correctly assess the evidentiary value of
any results (or null results) in the analysis.
This should be done before going to the field,
across the entire range of research questions
your study might try to answer,
so you know the relative tradeoffs you will face
by changing your sampling and randomization schemes
and can select your final strategy appropriately.

The classic definition of power is
``the likelihood that your design detects a significant treatment effect,
given that there is a non-zero true effect in reality''.
Here we will look at two useful practical applications
of that definition and show what quantitative results can be obtained.
We suggest doing all power calculations by simulation;
you are very unlikely to be able to determine analytically
the power of your study unless you have a very simple design.
Stata has some commands that can calculate power for
very simple designs -- \texttt{power} and \texttt{clustersampsi} --
but they will not answer most of the practical questions
that complex experimental designs require.

To determine the \textbf{minimum detectable effect}\sidenote{\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Minimum_Detectable_Effect}}
\index{minimum detectable effect}
-- the smallest true effect that your design can detect --
conduct a simulation for your actual design.
The structure below uses fake data,
but you should use real data whenever it is available,
or you will have to make assumptions about the distribution of outcomes.
If you are willing to make even more assumptions,
you can use one of the built-in functions.\sidenote{\url{https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Power_Calculations_in_Stata}}

Here, we use an outer loop to vary the size of the assumed treatment effect,
which is later used to simulate outcomes in a ``true''
data-generating process (DGP).
The data generating process is written similarly to a
regression model, but it is a separate step.
A data generating process is the ``truth''
that the regression model is trying to estimate.
If our regression results are close to the DGP,
then the regression is ``good'' in the sense we care about.
For each of 100 runs indexed by \texttt{i},
we ask the question: If this DGP were true,
would our design have detected it in this draw?
We run our planned regression model including all controls and store the result,
along with an indicator of the effect size we assumed.

When we have done this 100 times for each effect size we are interested in,
we have built a large matrix of regression results.
That can be loaded into data and manipulated directly,
where each observation represents one possible randomization result.
We flag all the runs where the p-value is significant,
then visualize the proportion of significant results
from each assumed treatment effect size.
Knowing the design's sensitivity to a variety of effect sizes
lets us calibrate whether the experiment we propose
is realistic given the constraints of the amount of data we can collect.

Another way to think about the power of a design
is to figure out how many observations you need to include
to test various hypotheses -- the \textbf{minimum sample size}.
This is an important practical consideration
when you are negotiating funding or submitting proposals,
as it may also determine the number of treatment arms
and types of hypotheses you can test.
The basic structure of the simulation is the same.
Here, we use the outer loop to vary the sample size,
and report significance across those groups
instead of across variation in the size of the effect.

Using the concepts of minimum detectable effect
and minimum sample size in tandem can help answer a key question
that typical approaches to power often do not.
Namely, they can help you determine what tradeoffs to make
in the design of your experiment.
Can you support another treatment arm?
Is it better to add another cluster,
or to sample more units per cluster?
Simultaneously, planning out the regression structure
in advance saves a lot of work once the data is in hand,
and helps you think critically about what you are really testing.
It also helps you to untangle design issues before they occur.
Therefore, simulation-based power analysis is often more of a design aid
than an output for reporting requirements.
At the end of the day, you will probably have reduced
the complexity of your experiment significantly.
For reporting purposes, such as grantwriting and registered reports,
simulation ensures you will have understood the key questions well enough
to report standard measures of power once your design is decided.
